                <h2>Welcome To Kankura Masat Social Welfare Society</h2>

                <p>
                    KMSWS is located in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. In 2006 the Ministry of Panchayati Raj named South 24 Parganas one of the country's 250 most backward districts (out of a total of 640). In South 24 Parganas, 37.2% of the population lives below poverty line, while 84.2% are based in rural areas. Literacy rate, male 58.9% and female: 41.1%, are lower than the Indian average.<br><br>

                    KMSWS was established in 1999. It is working to improve the poor conditions of education, environment, and health in the Masat region located in South 24 Parganas district. Since 2001, we are engaged in running pre-primary and primary schools for local children. At KMSWS, we regularly organize health check up clinics for mothers and their children. As part of our livelihood improvement program, we have taken initiatives to organize vocational training for local unemployed youth. In the environment and sustainable agricultural front, our activities include raising awareness about the usefulness of organic farming among local farmers. As far as the senior citizens are concerned, we regularly arrange medical camps, cultural programs to take care of their needs.
